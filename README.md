## Details & How to Play

- A trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

- If the player selects the correct answer, a screen congratulates them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, the next question is displayed.

- The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  - If the player runs out of time, the player is told that time's up and the correct answer is displayed. After a few seconds, the next question is shown.
  - If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player is told they selected the wrong option and the correct answer is displayed. After a few seconds, the next question is shown.

- On the final screen, the player sees the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game.
