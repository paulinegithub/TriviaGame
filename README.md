# TriviaGame

(https://plsenh.github.io/TriviaGame/)

* A trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, a screen congratulates them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, the next question is displayed.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  * If the player runs out of time, the player is told that time's up and the correct answer is displayed. After a few seconds, the next question is shown.
  * If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player is told they selected the wrong option and the correct answer is displayed. After a few seconds, the next question is shown.

* On the final screen, the player sees the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game.
